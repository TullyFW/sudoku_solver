# sudoku_solver
OES Comp Sci 1b: Python & Data Science Final Project

The code was written in Spyder. It takes in an 81 digit string, creates a board, and prints the farthest it was able to get in solving that board (hopefully completed)
Most info should be understandable through the comments on the actual code
One last note: the contradiction checking process was working perfectly before and could solve most evil difficulty puzzles, but it might not work now.I didn't remember changing anything in the code but I must have accidentally.
